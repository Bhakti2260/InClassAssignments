        <p id="para1">what is Lorem Ipsum?
            Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the
            Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and
            improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of 'dolorem ipsum' ('pain itself').

            Why do we use it?
            In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual
            form
            of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a placeholder
            before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking,
            which
            allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text
            influencing
            the design.</p>


        </p>
        <p id="para 2"> where does it from?
            The discovery of the text's origin is attributed to Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar at Hampdenâ€“Sydney
            College. McClintock connected Lorem ipsum to Cicero's writing sometime before 1982 while searching for
            instances
            of the Latin word consectetur, which was rarely used in classical literature.[2] McClintock first published
            his
            discovery in a 1994 letter to the editor of Before & After magazine,[9] contesting the editor's earlier
            claim
            that Lorem ipsum held no meaning.[2]

            The relevant section of Cicero as printed in the source is reproduced below with fragments used in Lorem
            ipsum
            highlighted. Letters in brackets were added to Lorem ipsum and were not present in the source text:
